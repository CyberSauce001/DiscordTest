# DiscordTest

<h1>Creating and Testing Discord Bot</h1>
<p>Learning and creating Discord Bot to test on my Discord server.
The Purpose is for learning how the bot works, enhancing my knowledge and coding skills.
It is a hobby and I want to expand my Python Language and maybe other language such as node.js 
or javascript.

If I do launch an actual working Discord Bot, it will be for my server only or unless I feel the 
need to share it to the world and they can add or modify the Bot and make it better</p>
